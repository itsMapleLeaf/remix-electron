# remix-electron-template

Welcome to your new remix-electron project!

## Getting Started

1. To install our app's dependencies, run the following command:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. To start the app in development mode, run the dev script:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Scripts

The following scripts are defined in the `package.json` file:

- `prepare`: This sets up remix dependencies after an install. Don't remove this!
- `dev`: Starts the app with hot reloading. Uses nodemon to restart the app when main process files change.
- `build`: Builds the app for production. Uses [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) to create a distributable package.
- `start`: Starts the app in production mode. Make sure you ran `build` first.
