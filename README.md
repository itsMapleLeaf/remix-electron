Electron integration for Remix

![demo screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Setup

Use degit to create a new project:

```sh
npx degit itsMapleLeaf/remix-electron/template my-desktop-app
```

## API

(todo)

## Motivation

Electron has [a comprehensive list of security recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security) to follow when building an app, especially if that app interacts with the web. Which includes, but is not limited to:

- Using `preload.js` files to expose specific electron functionality to your app, via globals
- Using IPC communication
- Avoiding `remote.require` (which has since been removed)

These practices can lead to a lot of awkward boilerplate and splitting up related code across multiple files and domains.

With this project and structure, you can freely use Electron APIs in Remix loader functions. It's a Node process with full Node capabilities, with access to the full Electron API, none of which runs in the browser.

The browser only receives data and renders a view. Additionally, you can neatly colocate your main process code right beside the related renderer code in a route file.

Thinking about it another way: it's like a normal Remix web app, except Electron is your backend.
